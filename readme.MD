# Magium Magento

A PHPUnit/Webdriver (Selenium (there for SEO)) based test framework for streamlining browser testing with Magento.  It basically boils down to building out reusable Web Driver commands for Magento allowing you to bypass much of the boilerplate code that browser/functional testing may require.  This is done through utility classes.
